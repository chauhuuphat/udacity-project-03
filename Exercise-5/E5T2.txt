1. Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: 
    a. Scan infrastructure as code templates. 
    ==> we will apply "terraform plan" to identify compatible of code, and then apply "regula" to check security complaince and missconfiguration.
    b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. 
    ==> Appling AWS inspector to scan vulnerabilities.
    c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
    ==> Appling AWS Inspector, Security Hub, and GuardDuty, AWS config.

2. For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability that it might expose.
- Regula: missconfiguration such as full permission for S3 in IAM policy.
- AWS Inspector: Updated operating system and application, network expose ports can access from internet and easy get attack
- AWS security Hub: Multi-factor authentication not enabled, S3 bucket permission, IAM policy do not apply least privilege, encryption of EBS or S3 not enabled.
- AWS Config: compliance not meet CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark, security group has been changed, resource created without compliance tags.

1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
By update security group just only allow listen port 5000 from ALB, our Web Application Instance did not facing internet and avoid attack from outside.
We can apply Cloud Fornt and WAF to web application, it can protect our application when facing to internet.
2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
==> It can not, VPC private endpoint for S3 is applied to VPC layer, if the attack happen in same VPC, the unauthorized still can access to secrets buckets.
3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
==> No, apply server-side encryption after creating S3 bucket just only encrypt new files, the existing file still un-encryption.
4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
==> All change from original cloud formation will overwrite configurations made by manually via console or CLI. That mean our changed via console or CLI will be lost.
